# Introduction to Pointers - Exercise

This exercise focuses on understanding pointers in Go, particularly how they interact with struct fields and function calls.

## Scenario

We are building a simple inventory management system. We have a `Product` struct that stores information about a product:

### Your Task

Understand the Code: Carefully examine the code in main.go and main_test.go. Understand how the Product struct is defined and how updateDiscountPrice is intended to work.

Run the Tests: Run the tests using go test -v in your terminal. You will see that some tests fail. Analyze the output to understand why they are failing.

Expected output
Product Name: Example Product
Original Price: 100
Discounted Price: 90
